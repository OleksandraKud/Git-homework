        I am Oleksandra Kudinova, a Ukrainian girl with a deep-rooted passion
        for creativity and innovation. Born and raised in Ukraine, I have always
        been fascinated by the intersection of art and technology. My diverse
        skill set includes graphic design, coding, and storytelling, which I
        love to combine to create captivating experiences. With an insatiable
        curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, I continuously explore new fields,
        from interactive media to virtual reality. Through my work, I strive to
        push boundaries, inspire others, and make a positive impact in the
        world. And i like cats.
